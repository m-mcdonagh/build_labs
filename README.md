# build_labs

2019 Senior Project

Application for creating arbitrary "Labs" to complete "Builds" which can be assigned to and performed by other users

Builds are
* a set of 2-dimensional parts, on the x-y plane, attached to its parent on a given (x,y) coordinate specified by a slot
* a tree whose root is the first part and children are placed on top of their parent at a fixed point

Labs are an ordered set of steps where...
* insturctional text displays to the user
* the user must choose the correct part from the set of all parts on the left, and place it into the correct slot on the correct parent
